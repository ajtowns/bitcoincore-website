# Introduction

This post is a companion to the earlier post on [Segregated
Witness Benefits](/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/),
giving an overview of the technical costs and risks that
may be incurred by activating segregated witness via [BIP
141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki).

## Aims

For the purpose of this post, we will use *costs* to describe negative
results that are certain to occur if segwit is deployed and activated,
and *risks* to describe negative impacts that may not eventuate, or
changes that are only subjectively negative -- that is a reasonable
person may not consider them to be negative.

When analysing risks, we consider steps undertaken to *avoid* the risk
(that is, to minimise the chance of it occuring), and steps undertaken to
*mitigate* the risk (that is, if it does occur, how the negative impact
can be minimised).

This post does not attempt to produce a conclusion as to whether the
benefits outweigh the costs or whether segwit should be deployed or
activated, but rather to assist by providing background information to
assist stakeholders in making informed decisions.
